h2. The obligatory refutation of RPC (Meteor.js)

p. Hi guys, just been reading through all the discussion of Meteor.js on Hackernews and noticed 
that the discussion had very little critique.   So here are just a few articles to think about and at the very least this post hopes to facilitate some discussion
of the cons of Meteor.js approach.

"RESTï¼šAn Alternative to RPC for Web Services Architecture":https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:LylgA_fL8q4J:web.uvic.ca/~erikj/seng422/resources/rest_paper.pdf+&hl=en&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESjYHfPLfpUiFhk4xLz6u9tSLXyTtcs6RVvV9ZdSqcNFjPNZ6iKmU5N7Ij0kYphZXmEqAL0VvVYGE9kT14vn7SveDWswWyL71LXn2neko4XEiM5PKaV_ZP5pH2kksIpaPgtcTgmA&sig=AHIEtbSBz804J-e96OlGr7I-LyV4ZDiLBQ&pli=1

As a front-end developer this publication articulates well some of my strongest concerns.

"Now.js released on Hackernews - 400 days ago":http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2316005

A user `jerf` gives an indepth critique and should proove a valuable insight.

"Erlang - This the road we didn't go down":http://armstrongonsoftware.blogspot.com.au/2008/05/road-we-didnt-go-down.html

More food for thought
