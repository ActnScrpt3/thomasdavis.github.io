<h2>restful ajax web app basics ( mimic gmail with backbone.js )</h2>
<p>The goal is to build a small example of Service Oriented Architecture (<span class="caps">SOA</span>) and Thin Server Architecture (<span class="caps">TSA</span>). We want our server to only produce raw data and never send <span class="caps">HTML</span>! ( We&#8217;re using <span class="caps">REST</span> not <span class="caps">SOAP</span>, no fighting).</p>
<p>This is a quick guide to get you started on building a one page web app that uses hashtag events and history to allow users to navigate your site without reloading the page ever.   Don&#8217;t want to be <strong>circle</strong> jerking too hard but todays tutorial will be using Backbone.js again.<br />
		  <br />

    <br />
h3. Benefits of Thin Server Architecture</p>
<p>Before I continue with the tutorial here are just a few pros I can think of for using a fully ajax app with a restful interface.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Less <span class="caps">HTTP</span> request</li>
	<li>Minimize the size of requested pages by always requesting <span class="caps">JSON</span></li>
	<li>Lets you build ajax interfaces which are fast and responsive</li>
	<li>Request are already <span class="caps">JSON</span> so if you ever need to build an <span class="caps">API</span>, it&#8217;s straight forward</li>
	<li>Google invented #! aka the hashbang for SE</li>
	<li>!flash</li>
</ul>
<p>I was excited the first time I wrote a fully ajax app and I hope that some of you can feel the orgasmic feeling of dynamically loaded content.   With the advent of the google <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/how-to-allow-google-to-crawl-ajax-content">hashbang</a>, you should be able to also build your websites/blogs with pure ajax calls now while still still reaping the benefits of google rankings.</p>
<p>Possibly one of the funnest parts is choosing an ajax loading graphic, I always use this <a href="http://ajaxload.info/">site</a>.<br />
         <br />
h3. Understanding the hash tag</p>
<p>Backbone.js implements two classes called Controller and History.   Using just these two classes we can constructthe entire backbone of our restful app.</p>
<p>To make a fully ajax website we need to use the hashtag, which up until this point has been used predominatly for anchor tags. Browsers don&#8217;t trigger any page refreshes with hashtags so using Javascript we can detect when the # location changes.   Instead of triggering the default behavior of finding an anchor, we instead load custom Javascript.</p>
<p>Below is all the <span class="caps">HTML</span> we will be using today.  Also note the inclusion of underscore.js, its a depdendecy of backbone.js and brings alot of power to the table.   I have simply set up four links that shall react accordingly and hopefully load data into our content pane div.</p>
<p>Liquid error: undefined method `join&#8217; for #<String:0x10157ffb0></p>
<p>For those of you who are lazy the full example can be viewed <a href="http://thomasdavis.github.com/examples/restful-app/">here</a> and downloaded <a href="https://github.com/thomasdavis/thomasdavis.github.com/tree/master/examples/restful-app">here</a><br />
		<br />
h3. Controlling the Controller</p>
<p>Below is the documented code that will run the restful ajax app.  Note that I have included a service called <a href="http://openkeyval.org">openkeyval.org</a> which is simplya free service for storing key pair values.  It is a great example of <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/spacemonkeylabs/thin-server-architecture"><span class="caps">TSA</span></a> and saves me setting up a nginx/reddis server.</p>
<p>Hopefully the code below should be simply enough to understand.   Most of you who have used a server side framework have probably experienced using Routes.  Backbone.js implements routes and you should quickly read the documentation <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Controller-routes">here</a>.   In the example I set up two types of routes one to catch specific urls and a standard catch all urls route.   Take note of the colon and asterisk, the appended string gets turned into a variable for convenient usage in your call back functions.</p>
<p>Using jQuery ajax call we specify the data type as &#8220;jsonp&#8221; to circumvent the foreign cross site policy.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Building fully ajax web apps/sites has never been easier.   I cannot think of any reasons not to and I personally love the feel of a responsive non refreshing page.   If you have built a hash tag web app or site before I&#8217;d love to see it so post it below.</p>
<p>If you see any errors or bad practises please do a pull request or simply leave a comment.</p>
<p>For the last example tutorial I wrote many members of the community proposed solutions in other JS frameworks.  I believe this is very important as the web starts releasing more and more Javascript frameworks.<br />
