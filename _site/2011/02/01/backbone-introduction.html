<h2>Backbone.js Tutorial &#8211; by noob for noobs</h2>
<p>The official <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">website</a> describes Backbone.js as a library to supply structure to Javascript heavy web applications.    After using Backbone.js for a week I could never see myself building any sort of Javascript functionality regardless of size without using Backbone.js or alternatives.</p>
<p>I have decided to write a quick introduction for those trying to grasp the mechanics behind it.   I am only a beginner also and would love suggestions and tips to improve my code.</p>
<p>I am also very curious to hear what you think about how <span class="caps">MVC</span> ties into Javascript development and the most effective library you have used for logically organizing your Javascript.</p>
<p>Would be great to get a discussion on <span class="caps">MVC</span> vs <span class="caps">MVVM</span> vs others etc leave comments at the bottom!</p>
<p>Also could you implement this example better in another framework?</p>
<h3>Understanding the Model View Controller Paradigm</h3>
<p>I have used many frameworks which promote that they use <span class="caps">MVC</span>.   I don&#8217;t think I have ever seen the same fundamental principals implemented the same way.</p>
<p>Backbone.js has 4 classes: Models, Views, Controllers and Collections.   The Models and Collections class work hand in hand and when combined essentially make up the M(model) of <span class="caps">MVC</span>.</p>
<p>The main concept I follow when using Backbone.js is to make Views listen for changes in the Model and react accordingly.   I would recommend bookmarking the homepage <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">documentation</a> and I perusing  the annotated <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/docs/backbone.html">source</a> code.</p>
<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>I am going to run you through a basic tutorial that should get you on the right path if you are a bit lost like I was when I started.</p>
<p>First of all we are going to just setup a basic page and include Backbone.js and Underscore.js(a dependency of Backbone.js)</p>
<p>Liquid error: undefined method `join&#8217; for #<String:0x1016544e0></p>
<p>For those of you who are lazy the full example can be viewed <a href="http://thomasdavis.github.com/examples/backbone-101/">here</a> and downloaded <br />
<a href="https://github.com/thomasdavis/thomasdavis.github.com/tree/master/examples/backbone-101">here</a></p>
<h3>Setting up the main view</h3>
<p>Each view has a <span class="caps">HTML</span> <span class="caps">DOM</span> element associated with it. You can read more about why <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#View-el">here</a> .<br />
Because this is our master view we are just going to associate the view with our page body in this example.</p>
<p>If the el(element) specified does not exist, Backbone.js will attempt to create it.</p>
<p>Liquid error: undefined method `join&#8217; for #<String:0x101654030></p>
<p>So we just wrapped our Backbone code with jQuery to make sure the page has loaded correctly. Then we create our main application view by extending Backbone and passing a <span class="caps">JSON</span> object with our options. We specified &#8220;body&#8221; to be the associated element for this view.</p>
<p>The events property is very powerful and lets us attach listeners to our views.   In the example above we have attached a click listener to our button with id &#8220;add-friend&#8221;. Read more about events <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#View-delegateEvents">here</a></p>
<p>After we have setup our AppView, we can just call to initiate it at anytime.</p>
<h3>Collecting the Models</h3>
<p>A Model in Backbone.js can represent any entity you like and in this case we want it to represent a friend. We can easily create friend Models but without any structure they become fairly useless to us because we can&#8217;t iterate through them unless they are grouped together.   So Backbone.js implements the Collection class which  allows us to order our models. Read more <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Collection">here</a> .</p>
<p>Now we get to the fun part. You can bind listeners/events to Models and Collections.   So whenever there are changes to the data we can call events to react accordingly.</p>
<p>We are going to add this code to our example which lets us add a friend Model to our friend Collection. We will then bind a listener to create a new list element when the data has changed.</p>
<p>Liquid error: undefined method `join&#8217; for #<String:0x101653ba8></p>

h3. Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this helps anyone trying to pick it up.   I don&#8217;t mind answering any questions that I have the ability to answer.</p>
<p>Would also love to hear to some optimization tips!</p>
<p>p.s.  Would love some insight into <span class="caps">MVVM</span>, <span class="caps">MVC</span> etc</p>
<p>Update: 	Changed the code to append the elements from the view and not the Model/Collection. The <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2158011">problem</a> was described on ycombinator by emehrkay</p>
<p>Update 2: A user called <a href="http://twitter.com/svenlito">svnlto</a> had a pull request to fix up the example code to implement better coding practises, he was spot on so I merged his request into the master branch. You can view the pull request <a href="https://github.com/thomasdavis/thomasdavis.github.com/pull/1" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
